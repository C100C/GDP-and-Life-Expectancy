# GDP-and-Life Expectancy 
This is one of my first data analysis projects. It aims to identify relationships between GDP and life expectancy for six countries. 

# The project seeks to answer the following questions:
1. Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
2. Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
3. Is there a correlation between GDP and the life expectancy of a country?
4. What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
5. What is the distribution of that life expectancy?

# Project Structure
1. Introduction
2. Loading and understanding the data
3. Analysis
4. Conclusion

The dataset used in this project is based on real data, which, to my knowledge, is not real. It was provided by Codecademy.

## Technology Used
1. Python and libraries such as Pandas, matplotlib, and scipy.stats.
2. Juptyer Notebook
3. Data Visualization

# Key Findings
1. Both life expectancy and GDP increased over time in every nation
2. There is a statistically significant correlation between GDP and life expectancy for these six individual nations.
3. The average life expectancy is 73.
4. The distribution is left skewed. With most of the data being 70 or more(on the higher end).

# Future Analysis 
1. As mentioned in the conclusion of this project. Getting more variables to determine how GDP and life expectancy are affected to create a multiple regression model.
2. Looking into Zimababwe's explosive growth in 2008 compared to other nations.
